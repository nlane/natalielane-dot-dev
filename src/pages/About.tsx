      <p>
        I am a senior full stack engineer with over 5 years of professional experience. I find joy in creating things and am passionate about any project where I feel like I can make a positive impact. Having always been pretty analytical, I am constantly aspiring to be more artistic. I have love for dancing, drawing, and knitting which all keep me busy in my free time.
