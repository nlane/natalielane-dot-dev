      <h2>A little about me...</h2>
      <p>
        I am a senior full stack engineer with over 5 years of professional
        experience. I love working on all parts of a project from fiddling with
        CSS to building out complete data models. Having always been pretty
        analytical, I am constantly aspiring to be more artistic. I have a love
        for dancing, drawing, and knitting all which keep me busy in my free
        time. You can see some of my art featured on this site ðŸŽ¨ ðŸ›¸
